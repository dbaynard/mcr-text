# College Societies

There are a large number of sports clubs and other societies at Emma.
Though Undergraduates mostly run them, Graduate students are welcome to
join. ECSU maintains [a list of current clubs and
societies](http://www.ecsu.org.uk/societies_and_sport) on their website.

ECSU provide
[funding](http://www.ecsu.org.uk/societies_and_sport/societies_funding)
for a number of societies. Funding is decided by the Allocation
Committee at the start of Michaelmas term, with small amounts of
‘contingency funding’ being made available by the Contingencies
Committee at the start of Lent and Easter terms.

# Sport in College

There is some sporting equipment available in the MCR, such as a
football.

The College squash courts are next to East Court and can be booked in
the Porters’ Lodge.

During the Easter term there are tennis courts and a badminton court on
the paddock, a crocquet set is available for use and the outdoor
swimming pool in the fellows’ garden is open (although it is a little
chilly!).
