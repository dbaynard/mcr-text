# Formal Hall

## “Normal” Formal Hall

All MCR-only dinners are advertised on this website in the “Socials”
section. In addition to these, College also runs Formal Hall aimed
primarily at the Undergraduates who cannot directly book an MCR dinner.

You can go to as many non-MCR formals as you like. They are almost every
Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday during term. There are no
dinners outside of term. You can take large groups on Tuesday and
Saturday by contacting the catering staff. The price of your ticket is
about £7. A single guest ticket costs about £10, but taking more guests
costs more per ticket, up to about £14 per guest for the three guests
maximum.

Food is served at 7:30pm, and you queuing starts at about 7:10pm. You
should be there by 7:15pm or so if you want to get a good seat. Your
name is taken at the door and checked against the signup. The food is
good, but unlike MCR Dinners, there is not usually port or cheese. You
can bring your own wine or buy it in the buttery, and the staff will
happily uncork for you at no charge. (They'll even bring champagne
glasses if you have champagne.) Gowns are required.

## Guidance For Behaviour At Formal Hall

-   Formal Hall is a special occasion and students should always have
    regard for their fellow diners, staff and college property. The
    following points should also be maintained.
-   Gowns should always be worn by members of the College in Formal Hall
    and everyone is expected to arrive promptly at 7.30pm.
-   The staff have the right to refuse admission to or to exclude anyone
    turning up who, in their opinion, is not in a fit state to
    participate in a civilised dinner.
-   People should not wander round the hall unnecessarily, as this
    affects the catering staff.
-   Throwing food is strictly prohibited. Drinking races or drinking
    games are not allowed at any time.
-   Formal Halls are not an occasion for flashlight photography but it
    is permitted after the Fellows have left the hall or after coffee
    has been served.
-   While the Fellows are in the hall there should be no toasting
    or singing. These activities are permitted, however, after the
    Fellows have left the hall as long as no inconvenience is caused to
    the staff.
-   **Pennying** and other drinking games are **strictly forbidden**.
    Anyone found breaking this rule will be asked to leave. Continued
    breaking of this rule could result in the loss of College's
    alcohol license.
