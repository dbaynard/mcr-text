# Elections to the MCR Committee

Elections to the MCR Executive Committee are held in Michaelmas term of
each academic year, usually early in November. See the section headings
below for more information about how the elections are held, which
positions are elected and what to do if you would like to be on the
committee:

## Election timetable

The MCR Committee Secretary will open nominations two weeks before the
elections. Notice of this will be sent to all MCR members via the
mailing-list.

If you would like to stand for any position, submit your nomination via
email to the Returning Officer who is in charge of carrying out the
elections stating why you would like to run. Nominations must be
seconded by members of the MCR and nominations close seven days before
the election.

Once all the nominations have been collected, manifestos for all the
candidates will be put up on the website for MCR members to peruse. The
manifestos from the last election can be seen as examples if you need any
guidance for writing your own.

The elections are then held on-line over two days and the results are
usually announced at the MCR Black Tie dinner in November. All posts run
until the following November, but those on one year courses can still
run and be elected. Volunteer committee members will then be co-opted to
fill those positions over the Summer Break.

## Positions available

The committee generally comprises of the positions described below.
Further positions may be co-opted by the committee.

### President

Represents everyone in the MCR at College and University level. This
involves attending many meetings to express the views and desires of all
MCR members (as well as of course keeping the MCR committee in check!).

### Vice President

The Vice President position on the MCR committee is new, to support and
complement the workload and efforts of the President. The MCR operates
in 3 communication channels – with college, with students, and with
external organisations. The Vice President is imagined to lead projects
in these areas when the President is otherwise engaged.

### Secretary

The secretary takes the meeting minutes, organises the weekly Bulletin
and organises the grad talk events each term, and is given licence to
personnel-manage/harangue committee members on minute-items not followed
up from previous meetings.

### Treasurer

Has lots of fun organising your MCR part of the college bill as well as
sanctioning all those crazy ceilidhs, bands, decorations for the MCR.
Organises the MCR stash each year.

### Computer Officer

Spends his/her life updating the Emma MCR webpage (amongst the most
advanced of its type in Cambridge) and mailing list. Familiarity with
HTML, jQuery, and PHP / MySQL (or willingness to acquire it) is
essential.

### Welfare Officer

The person in the know about all things to do with welfare. This
involves liaising with welfare representatives at College and University
level, as well as knowing everything about topics ranging from Chlamydia
screening to funding opportunities.

### Accommodation Officer

The point of call for all College housing-related problems and sits on
the College Buildings and Services Committee. A lot of the job involves
chasing people up to fix things as well as undertaking the yearly
Accommodation Review.

### Social Secretaries

These three socialites are each given one of the following roles:

-   Dinners Sec (unsurprisingly organises the MCR dinners, opening sign
    ups and co-ordinating table planners)
-   Events Sec (sorts the post-dinner entertainment, from casino nights
    to DJs, as well as other one off events during the year, such as the
    MCR trip abroad)
-   Swaps Sec (arranges the formal swaps so MCR members can experience
    dinners at a range of different colleges and welcomes guests from
    those colleges to Emma)

of the female graduate students in Emma as well as participating in
discussions and activities concerning women’s issues at a
University-wide level.

officer works with College to promote new eco-friendly initiatives.

Committee. Is always available for guidance and support on any LGBT+
issues or concerns.

### International Officer

Organises a range of events for international graduate students
throughout the year. Available to answer queries specific to
international students and works with the committee and college to solve
any problems.

## General points about being on the committee

Although each job obviously has its particular responsibilities the
whole committee helps out at MCR dinners and other big events. Being
part of the MCR committee is a good laugh and also gives you the
opportunity to put something back into College life.

### Do consider being on the committee if:

-   You enjoyed taking part in Freshers’ week events and MCR stuff since
    then and want to get more involved this time round.
-   You have lots of new and exciting ideas re:
    dinners/meetings/events/accommodation/all of the above.
-   You like organising parties etc. and want find out more about the
    college, learn the names of the porters/chefs, get keys to the
    cellars, dine at high table…
-   You fancy meeting a whole new bunch of people and getting dragged to
    lots of events kicking and screaming.
-   You think you can do better than the outgoing MCR committee.
-   You like standing up and making a prat of yourself in front of
    120 people.

### Don’t get involved in the MCR Committee if:

-   You just want points on the CV.
-   You haven’t got the time to spare because you are a Blues
    rower/manic workaholic/manic socialite with 5,000 engagements
    each week.
-   You can’t commit to attending committee meetings every two weeks
    during term time.
