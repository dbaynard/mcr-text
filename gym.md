# Fitness Suite

The college has a fitness suite in the basement of 22 Parkside. Entrance
is down the stairs next to the ‘School’ road sign. The gym contains
running machines, ergo machines, fitness bikes and a range of weight
machines and free weights.

To use the gym, members must be registered and go through an induction.
Main inductions happen just after Freshers’ Week and Re-freshers’ Week,
each October and January, though smaller induction sessions can be
arrange by the MCR Committee throughout the year if needed. Contact the
[Welfare Officer](mailto:welfare@emmamcr.org.uk) to arrange an
induction. Once inducted, members should have their Uni cards activated
for the gym door by the Porters.

If you have any questions about the gym, please contact the [Welfare
Officer](mailto:welfare@emmamcr.org.uk).
