# Rents and Charges

Rooms are classified into 8 grades, according to their size, quality and
proximity to the College site. The higher the grade, the higher the
rent. Typically, the rent difference between two adjacent grades is
about 7%.

In recent years, it was agreed with College that rents would be
increased until grade 5 rent was in line with the University average.
Regrettably this represents a rather large increase, although 80% of
College rooms are grade 4 or below.

In order to avoid large increases within any one year, the College has
adopted a rather complex "cohort" rental system. Under this system, the
rent you are charged depends on what year you joined the College.

It is important to note that PhD students are charged in four 12 week
terms, and thus only pay for 48 weeks over the year.

In addition to rents, students in College housing pay a mandatory
contribution towards the upkeep of the College kitchens (and receive
subsidised food in return). The contribution you pay is included in your
College rent, and varies according to how far you live from the college
site

-   Students on the College site: £175.30
-   Band A: £140.20 (Park Lodge)
-   Band B: £70.10 (Barnwell, Tenison 33 and 43, Cutter Ferry House,
    Norwich Street 8)
-   Band C: £35.00 (Hills Road 285 and 287)

Equivalent monthly rent calculation (assuming whole year occupancy and
band B kitchen charge)
