# Rents and Charges

Rooms are classified into 8 grades, according to their size, quality and
proximity to the College site. The higher the grade, the higher the
rent. In order to avoid large increases within any one year, the College
has adopted a "cohort" rental system. Under this system, the rent you
are charged depends on what year you joined the College.

It is important to note that PhD students are charged in four 12 week
terms, and thus only pay for 48 weeks over the year.

In addition to rents, students in College housing pay a mandatory
contribution towards the upkeep of the College kitchens (and receive
subsidised food in return). The contribution you pay is included in your
College rent, and varies according to how far you live from the college
site. This contribution is paid once a term (three times a year).

-   Students on the College site: £178.00
-   Band A: £142.30 (Park Lodge)
-   Band B: £71.10 (Barnwell, Tenison 33 and 43, Cutter Ferry House,
    Norwich Street 8)
-   Band C: £35.50 (Hills Road 285 and 287)
