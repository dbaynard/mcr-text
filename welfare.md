A variety of issues fall into the category of 'welfare': finance,
health, disability, child care, academic problems, sexual harassment,
racism, safety, accommodation, parking your car, personal problems,
overseas students, career decisions and grants. The MCR Welfare Officer
is responsible for helping out graduates with these issues. Their main
role is to act as a representative for Emmanuel graduates in college
matters such as accommodation and safety, but they are also the person
to contact if you need advice on how to approach the University about
welfare issues. The Welfare Officer receives information from CUSU (the
Cambridge University Students' Union), the Graduate Union and the NUS
(National Union of Students), and is present at meetings where Cambridge
Students' welfare is on the agenda.

The MCR Women's Officer is responsible for the well-being of all
individuals in the MCR, providing support and information about an array
of personal issues, but with a particular focus on those issues
concerning our graduate women. The Women's Officer provides our
[anonymous pregnancy test
service](index.php?page=welfare_pregnancy_test "Request a Pregnancy Test"),
attends fortnightly Women's Council meetings (refer to
[www-womens.cusu.cam.ac.uk](http://www-womens.cusu.cam.ac.uk/)) and
receives and distributes information about sexual health, pregnancy,
domestic violence, eating disorders, breast cancer, rape, child care and
events for women in Cambridge. Leaflets, posters and other information
are placed on the notice boards in Front Court and in the 'Welfare Box'
in the MCR. The Women's Officer is there to ensure the rights of women
in the Emmanuel MCR and can be consulted if students have issues they
would like to be raised within college or at CUSU meetings.

contact their graduate tutor.

The College also has two disability liaison officers, who ensure that
all students receive adequate support, and are regularly in touch with
the University’s disability resource centre. The current liaison
officers are the College registrar [Angela
Elliot](mailto:ae215@emma.cam.ac.uk), and the senior tutor [Dr. Robert
Henderson](mailto:rmh1003@cam.ac.uk).

Students with temporary disabilities (broken limbs, concussions, illness
etc.), are strongly encouraged to inform their graduate tutor- as the
College may be able to offer substantial support to ensure that your
academic life is affected as little as possible.

The university-wide Disability Resource Centre also provides information
for students on a variety of issues such as building access, funding and
support. Their [website](http://www.disability.admin.cam.ac.uk) has
