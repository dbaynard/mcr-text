# Emma May Ball and June Event

May Week is the week (in June!) when all the Cambridge colleges run
balls for their students to attend after exams have been held and before
the long vacation.

Emma alternates between holding a May Ball one year and then a June
Event the next. Both are black tie events but the Emma May Balls go on
slightly longer into the early hours of the morning than the Emma June
Events.

A committee is appointed up to a year prior to the event and takes
responsibility for picking the theme, decor, food, alcohol etc.

Emma is taken over for a night for the May Balls and June Events, which
spread over the courtyards and gardens of the college. Both the May
Balls and the June Events are jam-packed with entertainment, from comedy
sketches through a range of music and dancing, food stalls, drinks,
photo opportunities, and random fun such as water zorbing, bull riding
or shisha.
