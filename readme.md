This repository contains the main text items for the MCR website.
This information will probably need updating fairly regularly.

# Migration from old website

template
:   Hard coded in the new site. The site must be rebuilt to change it.

subsite
:   There is a whole section of the site devoted to this now.

widget
:   Self-contained, and can be moved wherever.

git
:   Stored (and editable) on github.

Generally the most frequently edited contents should be on git or a subsite, and the rest in widgets & templates.
