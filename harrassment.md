#Sexual Harrassment Policy

## Zero Tolerance Campaign

Emmanuel College MCR operates a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual
harasssment. This policy states:

-   That sexual harassment should not be tolerated, and those who commit
    acts of sexual harassment should be stopped and disciplined for
    their actions.
-   That although sexual harassment predominantly affects women
    students, the policy should and must be applicable to all students,
    regardless of gender, sexuality, or any other characteristic.
-   That no student at this institution should be forced to just 'put
    up' with sexual harassment, and that action must be taken to ensure
    all students are able to enjoy their time at university without
    experiencing sexual harassment.

The following types of behaviour are defined as sexual harrasment under
the zero-tolerance policy:

-   Unwanted sexual comments (including comments about your body or
    private life).
-   Unwelcome sexual invitations, innuendoes, and offensive gestures.
-   Wolf whistling, catcalling or offensive sexual noises.
-   Groping, pinching or smacking of your body, such as your bottom
    or breasts.
-   Having your skirt or top lifted without agreeing.
-   Someone exposing their sexual organs to you without consent.
