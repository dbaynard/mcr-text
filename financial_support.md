# Financial Support

All graduates are admitted on condition that they have the full funding
(both fees and maintenance) required for their course and admission is
only confirmed once satisfactory financial guarantees have been
received. The College is not willing to assist graduates whose financial
guarantee is not fully honoured, unless this is because of unforeseeable
circumstances. Self-funded overseas graduates should take appropriate
steps to insure against adverse changes in exchange rates.

## The College does however make grants as follows:

-   [Conference Expenses](#conference_expenses)
-   [Fieldwork Expenses](#fieldwork_expenses)
-   [University Sports](#university_sports)
-   [Computer Software and Equipment](#computing_equipment)
-   [Music Lessons](#music_lessons)
-   [Thesis Production Costs](#thesis_production)
-   [External Research Studentships](#external_studentships)
-   [Bachelor Scholarships](#bachelor_scholarships)

-   [Derek Brewer Research Studentship and MPhil
    Studentships](#derek_brewer)
-   [Cambridge Philosophical Society](#philosophical_society)
-   [Access to Learning Fund](#access_to_learning)
-   [Medical Expenses](#medical_expenses)
-   [Panton Trust Awards](#panton_trust)
-   [Rent Rebates](#rent_rebates)
-   [Hardship Grants](#hardship)

Further information is available on the [CUSU
website](http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/welfare/finance/).

## Conference Expenses {#conference_expenses}

PhD students can apply for one or more grants totalling no more than
£450 during their three years to enable them to attend a conference.
Students must ask both their department and their major funding source
for assistance before the College will consider the request. For MPhil
students the maximum that can be applied for is £150. In certain
subjects, such as Spanish and Latin American Studies, Mathematics, Plant
Sciences and Theology earmarked funds exist, which could allow larger
awards to be made.

The conference funding application form can be [downloaded
here TODO](uploads/other_important_documents/ConfApplicForm.doc).

### Fieldwork Expenses {#fieldwork_expenses}

It is expected that students' own departments will meet all research
expenses involved in a PhD or MPhil project. Students should consider
whether the resources available are adequate before settling on a
particular project. Nevertheless, the College is prepared to consider
applications from PhD students for one or more grants totalling no more
than £450 during the three years to assist with the costs of working
away from Cambridge, either fieldwork or conducting research in other
laboratories, libraries, etc. or attending a taught course relevant to
their research. Only the additional costs of working away compared with
working in Cambridge will be considered. Application forms are available
from the Tutorial Office. For MPhil students the maximum that can be
applied for is £150. In certain subjects, such as Spanish and Latin
American Studies, Mathematics, Plant Sciences and Theology earmarked
funds exist, which could allow larger awards to be made.

### University Sports {#university_sports}

The College makes grants from the Windsor fund to assist students
engaged in sports at University level or higher. The Windsor Committee
usually refunds about 50% of the allowable expenses, up to a maximum of
£250. Allowable expenses include subscription fees, match fees, travel
costs, sports clothing and equipment but do not include the costs of
social events or non-sports clothing (such as ties or blazers).
Applications should be made in writing to your tutor, listing all
allowable expenses and including receipts wherever possible.

### Computer Software and Equipment {#computing_equipment}

Grants can be made from the Sansom Fund to assist in the purchase of
computer equipment or software where it is necessary for the student's
work and where the expense would otherwise cause some financial
difficulty. Applications should be made in writing to your tutor and
should include:

1.  full details of the costs involved
2.  an explanation of why the purchase is necessary and why the
    facilities available within College or your department are
    inadequate
3.  a breakdown of your total annual income and details of any
    exceptional expenditure which you have to make (over and above the
    normal accommodation and subsistence costs).

### Funding for Music Lessons - The Burnaby and Jamieson Funds {#music_lessons}

Emmanuel College can provide funding for private instrumental and
singing lessons for members of the college who make a substantial
contribution to musical life in the college (which usually means taking
part in ensembles and/or giving recitals in college). The committee of
the Burnaby and Jameson funds meets annually in December and makes
grants to cover (usually) part of the cost of lessons.

To apply for a grant, write to the [Director of
Music](mailto:clw36@cam.ac.uk) by the [last day of Michaelmas Full
Term](http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/termdates.html) (**For the 2010 - 2011
academic year the deadline was Friday 3rd December 2010**). Include in
the letter the cost and frequency of lessons taken and anticipated for
the academic year, and give details of your involvement in college
music.

For more information contact the [Director of
Music](mailto:clw36@cam.ac.uk).

### Thesis Production Costs {#thesis_production}

The Board of Graduate Studies makes grants to assist with thesis
production costs, which the College will match up to a maximum of £50.
Application forms are available from the Tutorial Office.

### External Studentships {#external_studentships}

The College offers an average of four external research studentships per
year. These are awarded to the applicants with the best academic record
who do not have a first degree from Cambridge. The value of the awards
is £600 p.a.. Applications should be made in writing to the Graduate
Tutor before 15th June and your supervisor should also write a letter of
recommendation. Applications from existing graduates will be considered
in competition with those from admission candidates.

### Bachelor Scholarships {#bachelor_scholarships}

Cambridge graduates who obtained a first in their final exams are
automatically awarded a scholarship worth £300 p.a..

### Derek Brewer Research Studentship and MPhil Studentships {#derek_brewer}

Every year the College offers one full-cost studentship (or more than
one part-cost studentships) to students intending to study for a PhD and
up to two full-cost studentships for prospective MPhil students. The
value of the full-cost studentships is equal to the University and
College fees plus the minimum provision for maintenance required by the
Board of Graduate Studies. Existing graduates may apply (even midway
through their course) as well as prospective ones. The awards are
primarily intended for Home or EU students but an Overseas student with
an ORS award may be considered if there are no Home or EU applicants of
sufficient merit. In addition, part-cost awards may be made from the
Benson and Carslaw Funds to students from Commonwealth countries. To
apply for one of these awards, write to the Graduate Tutor before 15th
June enclosing a CV (with all available exam marks), a one-page
description of your proposed research, and an account of the funding
that you have available, have applied for or intend to apply for. Also
ask two referees to send references direct to the Graduate Tutor. Home
and EU students are expected to also apply for a Research Council
studentship, one of the University's [Domestic Research
Studentships](http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/funding/aid/drs/),
and any other available studentships.

### Cambridge Philosophical Society {#philosophical_society}

All PhD students in the sciences (including Maths and Engineering) are
eligible to join the [Cambridge Philosophical
Society](http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/cps/). This society offers
travel grants and grants to assist students who overrun their grant. All
science students who might need to stay on into their tenth term are
strongly advised to join the society before the end of their second
year, otherwise they are not eligible to apply for assistance.

### Access to Learning Fund {#access_to_learning}

The University administers the Access to Learning Fund (which comes from
the Government). These funds are primarily used to support students with
exceptional costs, e.g. because of living in non-College accommodation
or having dependent children or because of a disability. Students in
their fourth year, who have overrun their grant, are eligible to apply
and are normally the main beneficiaries. Clinical Medics and Vets with
little parental support are also likely to benefit. Only Home students
are eligible. Applications forms are available from the Tutorial Office.

### Medical Expenses {#medical_expenses}

In exceptional cases the College will give assistance with medical costs
where appropriate treatment:

1.  is not available from the NHS
2.  is considered necessary in order for the student to carry out
    his/her studies
3.  will only be short term. The College will usually in these cases
    seek to share the costs with the University's Crane's Charity Fund.

### Panton Trust Awards {#panton_trust}

The Panton Trust is a charity which has for a number of years made
awards to Emmanuel students to enable them to go on expeditions or trips
to work with or study animals (anywhere in the world) or study
conservation or ecology (in the UK). Applications should be made through
your Tutor. The deadline is normally around the middle of the Lent Term.

### Rent Rebates {#rent_rebates}

A proportion of all rents paid by students is used to provide rent
rebates for poorer students. For home undergraduates this is done
automatically on the basis of their LEA assessments but there is no
equivalent measure for graduate students. Therefore graduate students
who think they may qualify should apply to their Tutor, giving a full
account of their sources of income for the academic year and any
exceptional expenditure. Students in receipt of a full studentship from
any source do not qualify but any student who is wholly or partly
self-funded (from savings, family sources or loans) or on
undergraduate-type funding (e.g. Clinical Medics and Vets, PGCE
students) may qualify. These rent rebates are normally decided during
the Lent Term. In 2005 the awards were up to a maximum of £890.

### Hardship Grants {#hardship_grants}

The College has Hardship Funds which can be used to support students who
find themselves in financial difficulty through circumstances which were
unforeseeable when they originally applied and are no fault of their
own. Students who wish to apply for a Hardship Grant should fill in a
[College Hardship Application
Form TODO](uploads/other_important_documents/application_for_hardship_grant.pdf)
and then take it to their tutor in person and be prepared to give a
complete account of the state of their finances and the reason for their
difficulties. In cases where a Hardship Grant is not appropriate, the
College may agree to make a loan instead. All loans must normally be
repaid before a student is allowed to take any degree.

The University also has hardship funds; the ones most likely to be of
use to graduates are [Research
Awards](http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/funding/aid/hardship/index.html)
administered by Board of Graduate Studies (for PhD students only).
Details of these and numerous other University funds can be found in a
special issue of the [Cambridge University
Reporter](http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/) published at the
beginning of November each year.
