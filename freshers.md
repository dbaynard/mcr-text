# Freshers’ Week 2015

The Freshers’ Week timetable is shown below. All MCR freshers are
welcome at any and all of the events.

Before you browse the week's schedule though, there are a few things we
need to draw your attention to:

## Freshers’ Dinner

In order to make sure no-one misses out on a space, all MCR freshers are
automatically booked in to Freshers’ Dinner on Tuesday night. You will
be billed for this to your college account in the same way you are for
all MCR dinners. If you have any dietary requirements, or if you would
prefer not to attend the dinner, please email our Social Sec for
Dinners, Jacob, at <ja558@cam.ac.uk> and he will update the list for
you. Freshers’ spouses and long-term partners are more than welcome, but
please email Jacob to check availability of spaces.
