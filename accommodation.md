# Graduate Accommodation at Emma

Emmanuel has about 100 graduate rooms to offer to about 180 students.
Most are in houses inhabited only by graduates, a varying distance from
the main college site. The main advantages of College accommodation are
living with other members of the MCR community, and cheaper rents than
the private sector.

## Room Allocation

The College aims to provide at least enough single rooms for the
following categories of graduates:

All students on one-year courses
:   Accommodation for that year

Clinical Medics and Vets
:   Accommodated for the whole course

Diploma of Architecture
:   Accommodated for the whole course

Overseas and EU (not Irish) PhD students
:   Accommodated for the whole course

UK and Irish PhD students
:   Accommodated in first year

Accommodation for students starting their courses is allocated by the
Graduate Tutor through a system devised by the MCR Accommodation Working
Party, which was approved late in 2004.

In the Lent Term graduate students who will be continuing their course
in the following academic year have the opportunity to select their
rooms from a list of available rooms in an order determined by ballot.
The order of priority in the ballot is:

1.  Students in the above categories,
2.  2nd year PhD students who have only had one year in College
    accommodation as a graduate,
3.  2nd year PhD students who have had two or more year in College
    accommodation as a graduate,
4.  3rd year PhD students.

PhD students who are going to over-run their three years and who apply
to the Graduate Tutor may be allocated rooms if there are any available
at the beginning of September.

## Accommodation for Couples

Emmanuel has a number of flats which are available to students of the
College who live with their partners. These are primarily for married
students who do not have families (though babies under the age of one
would be allowed) but members who are in long-term relationships can
apply for a flat and College will consider each application on its own
merit. Since the number of flats is fairly low, it is suggested that
members contact the Graduate Tutor as soon as possible if they are
thinking of applying for this accommodation.

## Rent Guarantee Information

A private landlord will sometimes require tenants to provide a rent
guarantor, before entering into a rental agreement. This policy is often
automatically applied to those whose status is "student", irrespective
of income from grants or certain types of savings. The best solution to
this is clearly to ask someone appropriate to be a guarantor. However,
whilst most people will have someone suitable they can ask (eg parents),
there can be difficulties for others; for example where the only
suitable guarantors live abroad or are retired with no income.

As the college does not control or monitor the personal finances of its
members, it is not usually in a position to offer this type of guarantee
either. However, in the case where a college member can prove to the
college that they definitely have the financial means available to fund
their rent for the duration of the proposed contract, the college will
be prepared to pass on this guarantee. Those wishing to seek assistance
in this way should contact the Bursar
([bursar@emma.cam.ac.uk](mailto:"bursar@emma.cam.ac.uk")), to discuss
their specific circumstances.

## Domestic Matters

The rules and regulations of living in College housing are laid out in
[Domestic
Matters](http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/documents/pdfs/Domestic%20Matters.pdf).

## Laundry

Anyone living in college owned accommodation may have one bag per week
washed for them at the hostel laundry in college (staircase H). This is
regardless of whether the college house you live in has a washing
machine fitted or not.

If anyone living in private accommodation would like to use the hostel
laundry, they can do so on payment of 15 pounds per term. Please contact
the [Bursar](mailto:bursar@emma.cam.ac.uk) if you would like to set up
this arrangement.

Self service washing machines and dryers are located in North Court,and
may be used by anyone. However, they need to be booked in advance using
the sheet in the Porters' Lodge. Laundry 1 and Laundry 2 are for
undergraduates and graduates and include a washing machine and dryer.
Laundry 3 can only be booked by graduates but only includes use of a
washing machine.

Most external College properties are equipped with washing machines and
dryers.

## Access to Rooms by College Staff

The current policy regarding access to student rooms can be found
[TODO](uploads/other_important_documents/access_to_rooms_by_staff.pdf).


## Cleaning Policy {#cleaning}

College housing is cleaned daily by "Bedders". The current cleaning
agreement between College and the MCR can be found
[TODO](uploads/other_important_documents/cleaning_policy.pdf).

## Moving Out {#moving_out}

When the time comes for you to leave College accommodation, it is your
responsibility to inform College of your departure by using the
[Emmanuel College Exeat
System](https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/contact/students/exeat/graduates/)
(Raven login is required). Failure to do so will result in your paying
additional rent! In some circumstances you can give two weeks' notice
but in general you must give one month's notice before you leave College
housing.

## Disability accommodation at Emma

Emmanuel has a small number of rooms especially equipped for students
with particular housing requirements.

Although not yet ready, an en-suite room will soon be available in Park
Lodge, which also houses 13 other graduates. This room will not be
wheelchair accessible, but it is hoped that it will prove appropriate to
some students whose needs require a personal bathroom. This room will be
allocated by the graduate tutor, Jeremy Caddick (<jlc24@cam.ac.uk>);
please contact him for further information.

Emmanuel has three specialised, wheelchair accessible en-suite rooms on
the main College site in “new south court”, which also houses around 40
undergraduate students. These rooms should be appropriate for most
students with particular requirements. We note however that new south
court opened in 2013/14, and suffered some severe overheating problems
in the summer of 2014 which have not yet been resolved.

Currently the College offers relatively little direct support for
students with disability, but this is an issue the MCR is drawing
attention to. We encourage any graduate student at Emma who feels in
need of additional support to contact both her/his graduate tutor, and
the MCR welfare rep (<welfare@emmamcr.org.uk>).
