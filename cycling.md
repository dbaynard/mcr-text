# Cycling

Code your bike — Emmanuel is EM, the year of your matriculation and then the
number you come in the alphabetical list. The codes and suitably weatherproof
plastic stickers are available from the porters lodge, get it done. Don’t
forget to write the number down somewhere!

## Lights

All bikes are required to carry two British Standard compliant
reflectors and lights. White on the Front red on the back. Do not rely
on a flashing LED — these are to be used in addition and to use one of
these alone will risk a fine. Police will give £30 on the spot fines to
any cyclist not complying with the requisite standards.

*There should always be spare lights at the porters’ lodge.* Please return them
as soon as possible. If you wish to keep them, you may buy them for £10 if you
send an email to the MCR treasurer. If you keep them for a fortnight it will be
assumed you wish to buy them.

## Insurance

The [CTC](http://ctc.org.uk/) offers student memberships for £16 per year, that
includes a few million pounds of liability insurance. It is a worthwhile
purchase.

## Theft

Cambridge has a huge problem with bike theft, so here are a few tips to
keep your cycle safe. Try not to leave it in vulnerable locations and
always always lock it up. Use a decent lock otherwise the professional
bike thieves will have no problem with stealing it away.

Lock your bike by the frame to an immovable object if you can. Locking it to
itself or just through a wheel is more risky — all those single bike wheels are
a testimony to why you should lock through the frame!

Whenever possible, walk your bike through to the
south court bikeshed, do not leave it right outside front court. This is
the most vulnerable area and several students’ bikes have disappeared
from here.

## The Highway Code

Cyclists like all other road users have to obey the laws. This means:

-   cycle on the left
-   obey street signs and lights
-   avoid pedestrian only zones
-   do not cycle on the pavement.
-   use lights

With the introduction of on the spot fines of up to £30 for cycling in
pedestrian areas (in Cambridge this includes the marketplace and the
Grafton Centre between 10 am and 4pm, Monday to Saturday) as well as for
not complying with the requisite night light standards, dangerous
cycling can be financially costly.

**Just as with driving, it is an offence to cycle under the influence of
alcohol. The same legal limits apply, and it is legally possible for
punishment to include points or restrictions on your driving licence.**

## Cycle Helmets

As CUSU says — It is considered to be an unwavering truth that no one
looks their best in a cycle helmet, but it should be added that no one
looks astronomically bad in one, either. Certainly not as ‘uncool’ as
anyone might look with their brains all over the pavement. Nobody ever
expects to fall off their bike, but every year thousands of cyclists are
involved in accidents, and over 70% of injuries sustained are to the
head. Cycle helmets work by absorbing the impact that would otherwise be
received by the skull, dissipating the energy of the impact.
