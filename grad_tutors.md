# The Graduate Tutors

The College is responsible for the general welfare of graduate students,
and any problems with accommodation, settling into College life, etc.
One function of the Graduate Tutors is to look after these matters. It
is important that you should feel free to consult them at any time on
any matter that is of concern to you, apart from problems specifically
relating to study which may be better solved through your department or
faculty.

There are two Graduate Tutors in College, each of whom is responsible
for half of the graduate students in College. Your allocated tutor is
dependent upon your surname.

[Ann Shannon](mailto:ams34@emma.cam.ac.uk) in the Tutorial Office is the
graduate tutors' secretary and can deal with many straightforward
enquiries, e.g. provision of application forms or letters confirming
status.
