## What is the MCR?

The MCR (Middle Combination Room) comprises all the members of the
college who already have a degree and are on a course of study at the
university. Most students are either on one year Masters courses or are
researching towards a Ph.D., but our members also include those on
clinical, diploma PGCE courses, as well as mature undergrads and
lecturer students. Members of the MCR are also automatically members of
the Emmanuel College Students’ Union (ECSU) and the MCR is affiliated to
the Cambridge University Students’ Union and the Graduate Union.

The MCR Room is a place set aside for graduates inside the Queens’
Building, opposite the Lecture Theatre, in college. It is accessible 24
hours a day and contains two computers for graduate use, a television
with dvd player and sky box, facilities to make tea/coffee, and a
collection of books and board games.

## What do we do?

According to our constitution, the MCR has four aims:

1.  To represent the views of the MCR members to the College authorities
    and any other body on matters concerning the interests and welfare
    of the MCR members.
2.  To provide amenities and entertainment for its members.
3.  To advance the education of its members.
4.  To administer and allocate funds made available to its members in
    their capacity as students, or as required by the MCR on behalf of
    its members in accordance with the objects of the MCR.

We provide social activities throughout the year, lobby the college to
provide adequate facilities and support for graduate students and make
our presence felt in numerous College and University committees.
